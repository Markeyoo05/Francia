                 <p class="description">In France, it is customary to greet with a handshake, often accompanied by 
                    "Bonjour" (Good morning) or "Bonsoir" (Good evening). Cheek kissing (la bise) is also common, 
                    especially among friends and family, with two or three kisses on alternating cheeks depending 
                    on the region.</p>

                <p class="description">Dining is an essential aspect of French customs. Meals are typically leisurely affairs, 
                    often starting with an apéritif (pre-dinner drink) followed by multiple courses. Dinner is generally 
                    served later in the evening compared to some other cultures.</p><br>

                    <p class="description">France is famous for its wine and cheese, and both are deeply ingrained 
                        in French culture. Wine is often enjoyed with meals, and there is a wide variety of cheeses, 
                        each with its own regional specialties and traditions.</p><br><br>

                       <p class="description"> France has a long-standing tradition of valuing education and intellectual 
                        pursuits. The French take pride in their language and literature, and there is a strong emphasis on

                           <p class="description"> France has a concept of laïcité, which refers to the strict 
                            secularism enshrined in its laws. This principle separates religion from the state 
                            and ensures religious freedom while maintaining the neutrality of public institutions.</p><br><br>
